## This is website solely belongs to llldy and built by them. I cloned their work  for learning purposes.

### What I've learned
1. So I've learned that it is very important when making or cloning website finding similarities like if color used more than once and is there same layout used. I realized that this is number one step collecting same colors
and same layout.

2. I realized that building is easy but making it right is really hard so I'm following to latter one. keeping in mind that not all users of websites are abled. as disabled people rely on softwares like screen readers, our job is to make it as accessible as possible with semantically structuring document and naming classes not based on decoration but intention of the page.

3. Now it's making sense why to keep code DRY and modular. I tried to follow as much as I can to DRY and keeping code modular approaches. 

4. Summary: I'm proud of myself that I built this website whic gave a huge confidence and motive to keep going :)
